"As the Global Warming myth unravels, the Climate Change Lemmings get more shrill and more hysterical with terms such as #ClimateCrisis and #ClimateEmergency and #Extinction.

And the more they need to shut down facts.

"@ProfPCDoherty @ConversationEDU Good work Peter. How many deliberately lit fires will you allow before it is an #ArsonEmergency ? 716 fires did not start naturally. 276 people responsible (so far). 55 charged for deliberate. How many is OK?
  https://t.co/bhu0jQpEV3","@ProfPCDoherty @ConversationEDU Great work, Peter. At what point do we classify it as an #ArsonCrisis? Of the 716 fires, 276 were intentionally set and only 55 people have been prosecuted. Is this acceptable to us as a community? https://t.co/bhu0jQpEV3."
"@ToomeyWright @FriendsOScience The arsonists who lite Australian bush fires to prove Climate Change, are the darlings of the Left.

"Sack Scomo protestors would do well to head out and volunteer their time to help those affected by the fires. 
But...feelings.

"This year a NATURAL weather phenomenon known as the Indian Ocean Dipole has meant a hot, dry spell across the country.

NOT climate change.","""The rising temperatures across the country are partially triggered by the Indian Ocean Dipole, a naturally-occurring weather phenomenon. However, the lack of effective prevention measures and 183 individuals facing charges for starting fires make it clear that the government has ignored this #ArsonEmergency.

"There are, on average, 62,000 bushfires in Australia EVERY year. 

A 2015 satellite analysis of 113,000 fires from 1997-2009 indicates 40% of fires are deliberately lit, another 47% accidental. 

Combined, 87% are man-made.

Not climate change. #ArsonEmergency","Did you know that on average, Australia has 62,000 bushfires per year? Furthermore, a recent satellite report found that 87% of the 113,000 fires between '97-'09 were started by humans. #ArsonCrisis #NotJustClimateChange"

"What a stunning piece of intellect.

This must be how Simon plans to win all his Twitter polls in 2020. Sheer genius.

If you think arson doesn't exacerbate bushfires, but Hawaiian holidays do, you might be a complete prat.

"Adam Bandt: ""Asked PM in #qt to account for the coal Aust exports &amp; its contribution to bushfires &amp; he dodged it""

So: coal exports cause bushfires.

In fact, the cause of the fires were, in the main, arsonists, many of whom were children.
